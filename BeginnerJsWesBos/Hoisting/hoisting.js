// Hoisting in javaScript will take your functions and basicially move them to the top and still run them 
//so you can run a function before it exsits 

//Why is this useful? 
//Perfer to find oput what does this file do and how does it do it? 



// There is also Variable Hoisting 

var age;

console.log(age);

var age = 10;

//Hoisting will move the variable or function to the top so it can still run
